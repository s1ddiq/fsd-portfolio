        <p>
          As a developer, my interests extend beyond just coding. I enjoy
          exploring various aspects of life, but my main focus tends to be on
          pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital world.

        <h2 className="text-3xl text-blue-2 mt-4">Digital Pursuits</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main digital passions is building websites that offer a
          seamless experience. I enjoy experimenting with the latest
          technologies, constantly looking for ways to improve and optimize.
          Whenever I feel the urge for a challenge or just a change, I update my
          website—so it's pretty much a work-in-progress that evolves weekly.
          Each update brings something new, whether it's a feature, a design
          tweak, or an experiment with a new tool.
